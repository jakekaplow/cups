INSTRUCTIONS TO USE
1.      Open the CUPS Visual Studio Solution in Visual Studio 2019 (Enterprise or Community).
2.      Right click on the solution in the Solution Explorer, and click on Configuration Manager. Check all 10 projects under the Build column.
3.      Build the entire solution.
4.      Start a DOS command prompt in Administrator mode, and change to the output directory of the build: (e.g., ipptool-github\vcnet\x64\Debug)
5.      Run the command ipptool.exe -t https://print.print.microsoft.com/printers/<shared-device-id or cloud-device-id> ..\..\..\UniversalPrintTest\UniversalPrintPrinterAttributes.test
6.      Log into your AAD tenant account when prompted.
7.      The output is a list of the missing/incorrect attributes that failed the test. Further details for each attribute can be found at any of the following online resources:
        1.  (https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipp-registrations/ipp-registrations.xhtml "Internet Printing Protocol Registrations")
        2.  (https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobprinterext10-20101030-5100.11.pdf "Internet Printing Protocol: Jobs and Extensions")
        3.  (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8011 "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Models and Semantics")
8.      The command to use the other test files, such as ipp-1.1.test, is provided in the comment section of their files.
9.      Besides the attribute test tools in the folder ipptool-github\UniversalPrintTest, there are some example test files provided by CUPS in the folder ipptool-github\examples, which you may also use. Some useful ones might include get-jobs.test and print-job.test.

NOTE: Following condition is not checked by the test due to tool's limitations. Please ensure that the printer attributes conform to this condition: 
All attributes in media-col-database must be consistent with corresponding media-xxx-supported attribute. 
For example, if media-col-database/media-type contains "auto" then media-type-supported attribute should also contain "auto". 

TROUBLESHOOTING
1.      If ipptool hangs when it is run, try renewing the access token of your printer by deleting the token.txt file (located in the same folder where you're running the tool) and re-running the ipptool.
2.      Double check that in the output after ipptool finishes running, you see the following line in the output:
                status-code = successful-ok (successful-ok)
        If you see something else, for example something like the following:
                status-code = client-error-gone (client-error-gone)
                EXPECTED: status successful-ok (got client-error-gone)
        In such a case, it is likely that you mistyped the device ID of your printer.
3.      If the solution is not building correctly, try right-clicking on the solution and clicking "Restore NuGet Packages".
